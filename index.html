                <p>
                    In the early 1900s, Chicago was known as the "Candy Capital of the World".<br> 
                    The National Confectionery Association was founded in Chicago in 1884 to 
                    promote candy products and improve candy-making standards
                    A confectionery store or confectionery shop (more commonly referred to as a sweet shop in the United Kingdom, a candy shop or candy store in North America,<br>
                    or a lolly shop in Australia and New Zealand) is a store that sell confectionery,<br>
                    whose intended targeted marketing audiences are children and adolescents.
                    Inspired by values like togetherness, integrity, and excellence, The Hershey Company's mission is to make affordable,<br>
                    high-quality snacks for people around the world
                    to build a leading international company that grows and develops the confectionery market.
